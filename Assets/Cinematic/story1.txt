In kingdom far far away there was a king. He was not particulary good nor bad king. We could say he was a completly average king for a king. But this king had a secret talent. He was in fact very good at martial arts. He thought he could beat anyone in close combat, so he banned all tools and weapons in the whole kingdom.
